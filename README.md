# Not Your Maid

## Concept

Design an application that resolves issues with roommates

* Create a household
* Manage and track chores
* Keep roommates accountable
* Never run out of toilet paper

## Motivation
In 2012 about 32% of adults living in cities have roommates

In some cities like Los Angeles and New York, that rate is upwards of 50%

One of the most common complaints about roommates is differences in cleanliness
